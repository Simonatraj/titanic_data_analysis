# Titanic Data Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the passenger data of the RMS Titanic to explore survival patterns based on demographic and travel-related attributes. Using Excel, the dataset is cleaned, prepared, and summarized with pivot tables, leading to an interactive dashboard that visualizes critical insights about who survived the disaster and the factors influencing survival rates.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises information on 889 passengers, with the following key attributes:

- **PassengerId:** Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived:** Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass:** Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name, Gender, Age:** With ages grouped into brackets (Baby, Adolescent, Middle Aged, Seniors)
- **Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard**
- **Number of Parents/Children Aboard**
- **Ticket Number**
- **Fare:** Grouped by fare ranges for analysis
- **Cabin Number**
- **Port of Embarkation:** (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton)

This structured dataset provides a comprehensive overview for discovery of survival trends and relationships across multiple passenger attributes.

## Data Analysis

- **Survival Rate Analysis:** Explored survival rates by gender, age groups, and passenger class, with results showing that women and children had higher survival chances.
- **Pivot Tables:** Summarized survival counts and total passengers by combinations of gender and age brackets, revealing nuanced distributions.
- **Fare Analysis:** Compared fare averages across ports of embarkation and passenger classes to identify correlations.
- **Family Relationships:** Incorporated analysis of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard to evaluate their impact on survival probability.
- **Data Integrity:** Treated missing and zero ages appropriately, ensuring categorical grouping maintained analysis accuracy.

## Dashboard

The dashboard included on the third sheet of the Excel file presents:

- **Total Passengers vs. Survived:** Visualized by gender and age group.
- **Survival Distribution:** Across different passenger classes.
- **Fare Insights:** Average fare paid analyzed by port of embarkation and class.
- **Key Demographic Visualizations:** Clear controls for quick exploration of various factors affecting survival.

This dashboard acts as an efficient reference point to quickly understand how demographic and travel-related attributes influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Open** the Excel file.
2. **Navigate** to the "Dashboard" sheet for interactive visual summaries.
3. **Review** the "Working Sheet" for cleaned data and in-depth analysis.
4. **Examine** pivot tables for statistical summaries across different categories.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning, pivot table creation, and data visualization
- **Basic Excel Formulas & Filtering:** To prepare and analyze data
- **Dashboarding:** Interactive dashboards constructed within the Excel environment

## Potential Extensions

- Integrate advanced Excel formulas or Power Query for data automation.
- Employ Excel Power BI for more dynamic, scalable dashboards.
- Expand the analysis with predictive modeling using machine learning tools based on the prepared dataset.
